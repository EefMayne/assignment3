          <h4>Background</h4>

            <p>My name is Adrian Gordon Leveris and I’m 24 years old. I was born in Greenacre New South Wales, I lived in NSW up until the end of 2012 and then I moved to QLD. I finished high school at the end of year 10 and received my School Certificate in NSW. My only current hobby is playing video games which include (World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Call of Duty and The Division 2) outside of working full-time and studying part-time. I do not currently have any IT work experience, but I do have experience with IT related skills ranging from building my own computer, HTML, CSS, C#, Java, ASP.NET, and Python etc. from what I have learnt from studying in my TAFE courses. My IT interest started at an early age when I was given my first computer by my parents, even since then I have been using computers for most of my life. I am really interested in Programming &/ Cyber Security as I love coding myself and seeing it come together to form a fully functioning application or piece of software makes me happy.</p>

          <h4>Understanding of how my <a href = "https://adriangleveris.github.io/A1-MyProfile/personalprofile.html">personal profile</a> will be helpful to my group</h4>

            <p>Based on my <a href = "https://adriangleveris.github.io/A1-MyProfile/personalprofile.html">test results</a> I feel as though I will be very helpful to this team(The Prime Optimizers) as I am a great listener, so I will be looking to make sure everyone is communicating via voice/text through Discord and Facebook messenger which we have chosen to use to address any issues we have. I am slightly introverted but that should not affect me too much in my team as I have been slowly getting out of my introverted state by interacting more with other people in my life. With my ability to be very agreeable, I will be trying to make sure that there are no conflicts of interests and everyone agrees on decisions being made by group members. As I currently run my own business, I am very organized, self-disciplined, diligent when it comes to planning, completing tasks myself and making sure that each task is completed efficiently by each team member and aim to achieve the best possible outcome as a team. There is a lot of work to be done in this assignment as a team, because of this I will be considering everyone’s needs and making sure they are able to complete their tasks within the given time. I may be shy and self-conscious yet has not affected me when it comes to online communication between other people in the past. As I am resistant to stress, I will be making sure I help anyone with what I can and be making sure the assignment is systematically structured and neatly presented. I am not a natural born leader, but I have been looking to take charge in my team with working out what everyone is doing with the help of others in the group in order to make sure every team member knows what they need to complete.</p>

          <h4>Background</h4>

            <p>I’m a 25-year-old Australian citizen, born in Perth, Western Australia. I lived in Perth until I was 4 years old, where I was moved up to the north west due to my family’s careers. I finished primary school in a small town called Karratha, where I then moved back to Perth to begin my studies at Belmont City College, which I completed in 2011. My current level of education includes a Certificate 1 in IT and Business and currently undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT through OUA. In my spare time I enjoy graphic design for video game application, as well as playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends. I do not currently have any professional IT experience, though through my hobby, I’ve acquired knowledge on GitHub and Unity3D, as well as learnt an intermediate level of C# programming skills.</p>

          <h4>Understanding of how my <a href = "https://pixelatednate.github.io/about.html">personal profile</a> will be helpful to my group</h4>

            <p>Based on the test results, I believe I’ll be helpful to my team (The Prime Optimizers) due to my Openness, and Agreeableness from the Personality Trait results, my Visual learning from the Learning style results and the Feeling aspect from the Myers Briggs results.

            <p>The reason I chose these particular points to focus on is I believe that the Openness and Agreeableness are both strong personal skills to have when working with teams, as being open about your work ethic and scheduling can inform your fellow teammates and allow them to make adjustments to assist you or others to suit the project best.</p>

            <p>The Visual learning portion, I believe can be helpful for the team, as I pay more attention to visual aspects of the assignments/projects and, whilst contributing my due portion, I also enjoy putting in extra work to make the assignment/project visually appealing.</p>

            <p>The Feeling portion of the Myers Briggs test more relates to the social aspect of being in a team, as I will often look for the best way to harmonize those around me into a cohesive team and will reduce arguments between teammates by not being openly critical of their contributions.</p>

            <p>All of this taken into account, I believe I can be a great addition to a team through my general personal skills, trying to keep everyone in the team happy whilst working on the project and making the end result look nicer for potentially a better outcome.</p>

          <h4>Background</h4>

            <p>My name is Ethan Fleming (S3806776) part of the group The Prime Optimizers. I'm 19 years old from Adelaide. My hobbies include gaming (League of Legends, Fortnite, CSGO), cars (Toyota Hilux, Subaru Impreza), and downhill mountain biking (2019 Norco Aurum A 7). Regarding my interest in IT, it started after going competitive in gaming. That inspired my interest in computers, and from there I wanted to study Information Technology with a goal of becoming a Certified Ethical Hacker. The IT experience I have is limited being restricted to my gaming history, computer building, HTML and CSS courses, and learning Python for fun. I'd love to learn as much as possible in any and all areas to expand my knowledge as much as possible.</p>

          <h4>Understanding of how my <a href = "https://eefmayne.github.io/personal_profile.html">personal profile</a> will be helpful to my group</h4>

            <p>After reading through the results of my <a href = "https://eefmayne.github.io/personal_profile.html">3 different tests</a>. I have conclude that I can work together in a group as a high functioning member. I’m quite organized, which may mean that I will be proactive in organising who does what, and trying to ensure that each person gets a task that they're good at. I’m a natural leader, but also have the capability to listen to people who aren't leaders and take feedback and information onboard. I am also able to support a leader if that person prefers to lead. So I believe that whatever situation arises I will be able to sort out and assist with. I’m highly energetic so I hope that helps people to be pumped about the subject, but I’m also wary of annoying people with constant questions and checking up on how they're doing. I have a high group communication skill, so hopefully that works in my favour in this situation and allows me and this group to communicate effectively. I think that other group member will find it helpful to read how I learn best as well as showing them how well I function as a group member and how I can assist best witj any issues or projects that we do. The information accurately portrays me, so when someone wants to find out how I function in a group, they can just look at the tests that I've done.</p>

          <h4>Background</h4>

            <p>My name is Jade. I am 32, I have 4 children and live in Bathurst, NSW. It was in my teens that I developed a love for the internet and all its components. But it wasn’t until I was an adult that I started an interest in the security side of things. I completed my year 10 school certificate in 2000 and recently completed Cert II in IT at my local TAFE. I do not have any IT work experience yet, but getting into the IT industry in any way possible is a main target of mine. I have grown to enjoy baking and decorating cakes as a hobby for my family. Their requests for birthday cakes have gotten more extravagant as the years pass!</p>

          <h4>Understanding of how my <a href = "https://jg4514.github.io/MyProfile/">personal profile</a> will be helpful to my group</h4>

            <p>I am an introvert, so I tend to work best under a leader rather than take on a leadership role myself. I use my head over my heart and I think things through instead of letting my emotions get the best of me. My team members will be able to sit back with the knowledge that once I have a task, I will see it through to the end and won’t be afraid to ask for guidance in order to benefit the group.</p>

          <h4>Background</h4>

            <p>My name is Austin Knight. I am an Australian born 18-year-old living Brisbane who graduated last year from Carmel College in Thornlands which is located south east of Brisbane near North Stradbroke Island. I only speak English, but I wish to learn Vietnamese as it is my next international destination on my ever growing 'places to visit' list. Apart from being a full-time student, I work at Victoria Point Cineplex as an usher. I am a huge AFL fanatic and barrack for the Cats. My family has a history in Geelong with my great Grandfather being one of the founding members of the Bell Park Footy Club which so happened to produce Jimmy Bartel, my favourite player of all time.</p>

            <p>My interest in IT has grown ever since I started using a laptop and could comprehend what it could do back in 2009. I set up our first home network at the age of 11 and that same year taught myself how to create a Minecraft server for my friends to play on. Fast track to the past few years, I have been known among my friends and coworkers as the go to person to fix any IT related problem. During my final high school year last year, I even taught my IT teacher a few things that he has now incorporated into his teachings for his classes this year.</p>

          <h4>Understanding of how my <a href = "https://merrysauce.github.io/profilewebpage/index.html#personal-profile">personal profile</a> will be helpful to my group</h4>

            <p>Based on the above test results, I feel like I will be a valuable team member in The Prime Optimizers. The biggest key trait among the tests is reliability. I hope I am a reliable team member so that we can achieve the best possible result and be better people for it. Since all members of our team come from different walks of life, I need to remain tolerable as we all have different working hours outside of our study endeavours. As stated in my Myers Briggs Test, Tolerance is one of my strongest traits, which is a huge bonus.</p>

            <p>Another trait that is also beneficial to the team’s success is being achievement driven. This ensures everyone that I am putting my 100% into my work and trying to leave nothing undone. I will also be able to help others with their own work to ensure we all get the best possible learning experience out of this assignment.</p>

          <h4>Background</h4>

            <p>I am an Australian born 35-year-old male who left high school at 16 to pursue my dream of becoming a Graphic Designer this was my first exposure to the IT industry but my real passion as it related to IT was, and still is, gaming.  I found the PC to be consistently superior to even the latest consoles. After I found the position somewhat stagnant, I migrated into sales during my search for greener pastures. It was then I moved to Sydney where I i first met Lindsay, who is now my wife of 9 years. Due to Visa issues the two of us moved to Manchester, England, which is where my career really came into its own as I was offered a job in the banking industry. With a better income, I was able to feed my IT related hobbies, building my own gaming rigs and trying to squeeze from them everything I could…overclocking video cards, building water cooling systems to accommodate tweaked processors, custom lighting and cable sleeving to get that sleek gaming look. I developed such a passion for building PC’s that I briefly ran my own business doing so, but unfortunately, I didn’t have the means to compete with the larger scale companies in what was, at the time, quite a specialized market. Now 10 years later, Lindsay and I have moved back to Australia permanently with the addition of a beautiful little girl, Aria, who is now almost 2 years old. I am currently studying for a degree in finance to become a financial planner in Australia.</p>

          <h4>Understanding of how my <a href = "https://zacvine.github.io/Personal%20Profile.html">personal profile</a> will be helpful to my group</h4>

            <p>As an introverted individual who feels most comfortable among colleagues and is uninterested in controlling others, I will probably need someone else to take on the leadership role but my similar distaste for being controlled makes it important that the individual playing the leadership role is suited to leading my personality type. I would much rather immerse myself in a project than just be told what task to do and move on and would much rather hear what I did right and focus on what to do, rather than what not to do. My results suggest I often take challenges and criticisms personally while at the same time avoiding conflict with others as much as possible. This could potentially lead me to harvest an unnecessary animosity towards team members if my feelings aren't kept in check. However, my personality type will also put a great deal of time and energy into trying to align my principles and the criticisms of others into a middle ground that satisfies everybody. A high level of Intrapersonal Intelligence would suggest a good ability to work well alone. So perhaps being in a group where at least a part of my role is something I can work on independently would be beneficial.</p>
