        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>My name is Adrian Gordon Leveris and I’m 24 years old. I was born in Greenacre New South Wales, I lived in NSW up until the end of 2012 and then I moved to QLD. I finished high school at the end of year 10 and received my School Certificate in NSW. My only current hobby is playing video games which include (World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Call of Duty and The Division 2) outside of working full-time and studying part-time. I do not currently have any IT work experience, but I do have experience with IT related skills ranging from building my own computer, HTML, CSS, C#, Java, ASP.NET, and Python etc. from what I have learnt from studying at TAFE courses. My IT interest started at an early age when I was given my first computer by my parents, even since then I have been using computers for most of my life. I am really interested in Programming &/ Cyber Security as I love coding myself and seeing it come together to form a fully functioning application or piece of software makes me happy.</p>

        <p>I’m a 25-year-old Australian citizen, born in Perth, Western Australia. I lived in Perth until I was 4 years old, where I was moved up to the north west due to my family’s careers.

My current level of education includes a Certificate 1 in IT and Business and currently undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT through OUA. In my spare time I enjoy graphic design for video game application, as well as playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends.

        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>My name is Ethan Fleming (S3806776) part of the group The Prime Optimizers. I'm 19 years old from Adelaide. My hobbies include gaming (League of Legends, Fortnite, CSGO), cars (Toyota Hilux, Subaru Impreza), and downhill mountain biking (2019 Norco Aurum A 7). Regarding my interest in IT, it started after going competitive in gaming. That inspired my interest in computers, and from there I wanted to study Information Technology with a goal of becoming a Certified Ethical Hacker. The IT experience I have is limited being restricted to my gaming history, computer building, HTML and CSS courses, and learning Python for fun. I'd love to learn as much as possible in any and all areas to expand my knowledge as much as possible.</p>

But it wasn’t until I was an adult that I started an interest in the security side of things. I completed my year 10 school certificate in 2000 and recently completed Cert II in IT at my local TAFE. I do not have any IT work experience yet, but getting into the IT industry in any way is a main target of mine.I have grown to enjoy baking and decorating cakes as a hobby for my family. Their requests for birthday cakes have gotten more extravagant as the years pass!</p>

        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>My name is Austin Knight. I am an Australian born 18-year-old living Brisbane who graduated last year from Carmel College in Thornlands which is located south east of Brisbane near North Stradbroke Island. I only speak English, but I wish to learn Vietnamese as it is my next international destination on my ever growing 'places to visit' list. Apart from being a full-time student, I work at Victoria Point Cineplex as an usher. I am a huge AFL fanatic and barrack for the Cats. My family has a history in Geelong with my great Grandfather being one of the founding members of the Bell Park Footy Club which so happened to produce Jimmy Bartel, my favourite player of all time.</p>

        <p>My interest in IT has grown ever since I started using a laptop and could comprehend what it could do back in 2009. I set up our first home network at the age of 11 and that same year taught myself how to create a Minecraft server for my friends to play on. Fast track to the past few years, I have been known among my friends and co-workers as the go to person to fix any IT related problem. During my final high school year last year, I even taught my IT teacher a few things that he has now incorporated into his teachings for his classes this year.</p>

        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>I am an Australian born 35-year-old male who left high school at 16 to pursue my dream of becoming a Graphic Designer this was my first exposure to the IT industry but my real passion as it related to IT was, and still is, gaming.  I found the PC to be consistently superior to even the latest consoles. After I found the position somewhat stagnant, I migrated into sales during my search for greener pastures. It was then I moved to Sydney where I i first met Lindsay, who is now my wife of 9 years. Due to Visa issues the two of us moved to Manchester, England, which is where my career really came into its own as I was offered a job in the banking industry. With a better income, I was able to feed my IT related hobbies, building my own gaming rigs and trying to squeeze from them everything I could…overclocking video cards, building water cooling systems to accommodate tweaked processors, custom lighting and cable sleeving to get that sleek gaming look. I developed such a passion for building PC’s that I briefly ran my own business doing so, but unfortunately, I didn’t have the means to compete with the larger scale companies in what was, at the time, quite a specialized market. Now 10 years later, Lindsay and I have moved back to Australia permanently with the addition of a beautiful little girl, Aria, who is now almost 2 years old. I am currently studying for a degree in finance to become a financial planner in Australia.</p>
