          <h2>What does it do?</h2>

          <p>Autonomous Vehicles often seem like something straight out of a science fiction movie. The first self-driving vehicle known to exist (WIRED, 2019)<sup>1</sup> was an invention by Leonardo da Vinci’s Self Driving Cart (En.wikipedia.org, 2019)<sup>2</sup> in the 16th century (See figure 1).</p>

          <div class = "box3">

            <img src = "../images/self-driven-car.jpg" alt = "Leonardo da Vinci's design of a self driving cart">

            <div class ="text3"

              <p>(Figure 1) Leonardo da Vinci, (2011), The original design of the self-propelled cart [ONLINE]. Available at: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%27s_self-propelled_cart#/media/File:LeonardoCardDrawing.jpg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%27s_self-propelled_cart#/media/File:LeonardoCardDrawing.jpg</a> [Accessed 8 July 2019].</p>

            </div>

          </div>

          <div class = "test">

            <p>This cart was able to have preprogramed paths set into it, and it would be able to follow them by itself with no one steering it or making it move forwards. The next massive outbreak was the first semi-autonomous car (Vanderbilt et al., 2019)<sup>3</sup> in 1977 produced by Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering. This Japanese company revolutionized and pioneered the autonomous vehicle industry that we see today. The car created in 1977 was a Volkswagen Tourag called Stanley. It was equipped with two cameras that used old analogy computer technology to process the signal. It could travel up to 30km/h and avoid objects. The only downside is that it had to use a guide rail. This was considered the first real autonomous vehicle.</p>

            <div class = "come">

              <p>We’ve come a long way since then with Tesla coming out with its fully functioning Auto Pilot system (Tesla.com, 2019)<sup>4</sup> in 2015 . This is a massive improvement with the new systems allowing cars to travel at up to 100km/h and over while being able to propel themselves as well as slow down to avoid incidents. There are 6 levels of automation that allow us to aim for a goal regarding what we want in the future and show us how far we have come since the start (See figure 2).</p>

              <p>There are a few main technologies used that result in self driving vehicles existing. The 3 main ones are sensors, connectivity, and software/control algorithms (The Franklin Institute, 2019)<sup>5</sup>. All the sensors we use today are quite advanced and allow the car to stay in its lane, detect obstacles etc. It’s only a matter of improving their reliability and safety. Connectivity allows the vehicles we utilize to gain access to all details that we take for granted. This includes weather, traffic, temperature, engine, infrastructure etc. It then combines those details to provide the best experience possible and ensure that your drive is safe. This is an area that needs constant work to ensure that the car is constantly updated and uses the information in the correct way. The most complex of the 3 areas behind autonomous vehicles is software/control algorithms. Because were allowing the car to make all our decisions for us, we’re just creating Artificial Intelligence.</p>

          </div>

          <p>Currently all cars are at the 3rd level of partial automation. There are some cars at the 4th level including all Teslas (no surprise there) but legally were not allowed to have level 5 and 6 automation as that means that we must allow computers to make all the decisions for us. Which comes into a lot of ethical issues since artificial intelligence is still a highly debated issue. Within the next 3 years most sources agree that we should be able to achieve the 5th level of automation which means that everything cane be done for you. Already cars can park themselves, drive themselves, accelerate, brake etc. Its only a matter of time before we don’t have to do anything, we can just sit back and let the car do everything. Regarding other vehicles besides cars, we do have fully autonomous planes now, that will fly based of a pre recorded flight plan. As well as take off and land by themselves. I personally find it interesting that no one minds that planes are pretty much fully autonomous now, but if you see a car without a driver they freak out. </p>

          <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>

          <p>I think that as autonomous vehicles become more commonplace. The way we travel will become much simpler. Things like Uber will become completely autonomous allowing people to order cars to come pick them up and take them wherever they need. It would just make everything much more accessible. Also, for people with disabilities it will make a massive difference. Once vehicles are level 6 autonomous (See figure 2), people with severe disabilities can have their own cars that they can “drive”. This would give them a whole new level of independence. I think it would make the taxi and uber service redundant, as the companies could cut the cost so much by not having drivers. But then on another level it would also provide new jobs for software developers, as well as creating many new jobs for mechanics. I don’t think that everyone will want to move over to driverless vehicles just because a lot of people enjoy driving their own cars. But I think if they made autonomous vehicles easily accessible, it would become a massive industry very quickly.</p>

          <p>If you look at the aircraft industry you can see that even though the massive airline planes like the Boeing 747, Airbus A380 are almost completely autonomous. They can fly, and land by them selves using the Autopilot feature (CNBC, 2019)<sup>6</sup>. Although people don’t trust Artificial Intelligence that much so we do have Pilots that do take off, and then fly the plane, but if they want, they can let the computer fly the whole trip and land. Even though pilots are almost irrelevant, they are still used in every single flight since systems fail, as well as people don’t trust artificial intelligence or a computer with their lives. So, in that respect I don’t think that vehicles will ever become fully autonomous with no user input.</p>

          <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>

          <p>I have a physical disability; I can currently drive my cars. But since my disability is degenerative, eventually I won’t be able to drive anymore. So, if autonomous cars were a reality to the point which I could use them by only steering or something like that, then it would improve my independence on a massive scale. There are plenty of people out there that are like me or worse. So, having an autonomous car would make a huge difference in their lives. It would allow me to go out when I want, giving me, independence and I wouldn’t have to rely on anyone to take me places.</p>

          <p>I think it would affect family and friends because it would allow my family to get to things when they’re busy. If they had an autonomous vehicle. They could study in the car while it drives them to uni. If they had something to be at, the car could go and pick the kids up from school. Its all about accessibility and making things easier for people. I personally think that it would change the world as we know it.</p>
