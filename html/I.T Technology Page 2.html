          <h2>What does it do?</h2>

          <p>The field of Robotics is a interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that involves the creation of Robots, as well as the design of the systems for their control, feedback and information processing. It can be broken down further into several subcategories such as:</p>

          <li>Military</li>

          <li>Industrial</li>

          <li>Domestic</li>

          <li>Agricultural</li>

          <li>Medical</li>

          <p>All forms of Robotics, however, serve a singular overall goal: To substitute human involvement with machines to better human life. A discussion on Robotics, published by the EU-OSHA (Kaivo-oja, 2015)<sup>1</sup> stated that Robotics pose a great potential benefit to health and safety of humans in hostile work environments. (such as defense, space, or the nuclear industry)</p>

          <p>As of 2019, the state of the art robotics vary depending on the field in which the robots were designed. For Medical Robotics, robots are capable of performing surgery (Robotic Surgery on a Grape, 2019)<sup>2</sup> with extreme dexterity, up to twice the precision as the best human surgeons, allowing for faster recovery times on potential patients. Another medical application of robotics is in the form of robotic prosthetics. Limb amputees are able to be fitted with a robotic replacement limb that picks up their brainwaves, allowing them to have a functional limb again, in the form of a robotic counterpart.</p>

          <p>In Military Robotics, robotic drones are already being used regularly by countries such as the US, Turkey, Italy and Morocco and provide an unmanned aircraft capable of carrying out airstrikes. On top of this, there are many different types of robotics used in active warzones to reduce soldier casualties by providing surveillance, supplies or even cover-fire for soldiers (10 types of Military Robots, 2019)<sup>3</sup>.</p>

          <p>Industrial Robotics sees automation of creation of products through the use of robotics. Large robotic arms have been automated to create cars for several large automotive companies for many years (Acieta.com, 2019)<sup>4</sup>. This technology allows for cars to be created at a higher rate and reduce work injuries for employees who have been trained to operate said robots.</p>

          <p>In the Agricultural Robotics field, automation is again the main goal (Association, 2019)<sup>5</sup>. Through the use of automated harvesting and weeding systems, the labor for farmers is drastically reduced, allowing them to focus on other areas in their work. This also allows for an increase in production speed, as more produce can be planted than a human would physically be able to tend to, yielding more crops during harvest times.</p>

          <p>For Domestic Robotics, there are robots designed to assist with everyday life. An example of this is the Alpha 2 robot. The Alpha 2 provides many different functions such as supplying information, setting reminders and providing entertainment (Indiegogo, 2019)<sup>6</sup>.</p>

          <p>The future for robotics is set to advance quite rapidly in the next few years, engineers are planning for robots to eventually appear more human-like to remove the stigma around such machines. On top of this, as processors become smaller and more efficient over time, robots can potentially have more processing power installed into them, allowing them to become smarter and faster than current standards. One rather important outcome in the future will be the emergence of true AI. As AI advances, the need for human intervention shrinks, allowing robots to autonomously perform their supplied tasks.</p>

          <p>The state of robotics, in its current form, owes a lot of its success and progress to the fields of Engineering, Computer Science and Metallurgy. As these three fields progress and produce faster, cheaper and more effective materials and methods, the field of robotics thrives in their successes and incorporates their latest achievements into their own production to produce greater machinery for mankind.</p>

          <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>

          <p>The impact of the field of robotics has already started to be felt around the world, many individuals have adopted robotics into their daily lives with relative ease. Of course, with any new technology, there are those that are skeptical or downright critical of its emergence. The vast majority of adopters are benefitting from robotic prosthetics, automated systems and domestic robotics to enable them to return to a normal quality of life.</p>

          <p>As the field expands into other forms of robotics, as well as the current fields becoming more advanced, we, as a species will potentially see the worldwide adoption of robotics in mainstream society. </p>

          <p>The people most noticeably affected by robotics will be farmers with automation systems and amputees with robotic prosthetics. Amputees would be capable of living a normal life again, without the struggles of their disability, thanks to a robotic prosthetic. Farmers may react negatively towards the automation systems and be slow to adopt them due to the misplaced fear that it would replace their jobs.</p>

          <p>The robotics field opens up a great number of employment opportunities, especially considering the niche areas that robotics can go into. (Agricultural, Military, Medical, ect..) As time goes on, we could potentially see robotics being adopted into all forms of education for the workforce.</p>

          <p>Many jobs will be replaced by the robotics field (CNBC, 2019)<sup>7</sup> through automation, however, through education and training, these workers may not be completely replaced, but transferred to instead ensuring the robots do their job efficiently and safely.</p>

          <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>

          <p>In the greater scope of things, I donâ€™t actually feel like the field of robotics will have a large effect on my daily life. Should I pursue it, I could potentially have robots assisting me in my office and home life to make my job and housework easier or even non-existent, however it would be through my interaction with the field and not the passive emergence of the technology that causes this.</p>

          <p>There are many potential differences for, not just me, but everyone in the future, as robotics become more prevalent in major public areas. A possible scenario is having robotic bus drivers around my city, whilst I do not take buses, many other people do. As the technology advances, we may see these types of introductions into everyday society that greatly alter our knowledge of life as we know it.</p>

          <p>At a more personal level, I think the biggest impact of this technology would be with my father, whom has a prosthetic foot. If the advancements in robotics continue, he could potentially live to see a robotic foot instead of a hardened plastic one, which I think would have a massive positive impact on his confidence and his mood in regards to his disability.</p>
