          <h3>Adrian Gordon Leveris</h3>

          <h4>Common Elements</h4>

          <p>So, based on everyone’s ideal jobs I can say there are some common elements in each role chosen: For instance, Ethan, Jade, Austin and Adrian have similar ideal jobs (cyber security specialist), more closely Austin and Adrian both have a minimum requirement of 5 years working expertise in the cyber security specialist role. Also, both our roles, including Nathan’s, and Jade’s will require excellent written and verbal skills. All our jobs apart from Zac’s are team environment based. There is also another common element which involves Ethan’s and Austin’s ideal jobs which is the practice of applying a comprehensive and rigorous method that will ensure the security of information using the available security technologies (Enterprise Security Architecture). Austin and Adrian’s ideal roles will require expertise in testing a computer system, network or web application in order to find vulnerabilities in security that could be exploited by a hacker. They must also possess the ability to suggest and develop new project ideas and stay up to date with any new technology trends.</p>

          <h4>Differences between all roles</h4>

          <p>One major difference is Zac’s ideal job which involves managing personal finances of clients is not related to Information Technology. Austin’s and Ethan’s roles will both require them to have passionate skills for their roles which involves making sure they demonstrate a high level of effort towards their work activities. All roles will require some form of documentation, for instance Nathan’s role will require him to document proper use of equipment involving virtual reality, augmented reality, and/or mixed reality. Ethan, Austin, Jade and Adrian are required to have expertise in documenting with documents such as Security Risk Management Plan, Threat and Risk Assessment, and Cyber Security Incident Response Plan. It would help if Adrian, Ethan, Jade and Austin had a certificate in a related cyber security certification or Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) that could be used to help them obtain their ideal job. Zac’s role will require him to gather relevant financial information, setting life goals, examining current resources and develop a plan that his clients can work towards given their current situation. It would be beneficial for Jade to have a certificate in CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional), or related certificates, which requires her to have a minimum of five years full-time hands on experience in at least two cyber security domains.</p>

          <h4>How similar are our career plans?</h4>

          <p>Regarding our team career plans, Nathan, Ethan, Adrian, and Jade all have similar plans with completing their Bachelor of Information Technology degrees. Also, Adrian and Ethan will be looking to improve their education level by completing a master’s degree in IT to improve their education level. There are also similarities with obtaining work in our teams related ideal jobs or fields similar in order to gain the necessary experience or qualifications they need for their ideal jobs.</p>

          <h3>Nathan Jenkins</h3>

          <h4>What common elements are there, if any?</h2>

          <p>Some of the common elements I’ve found is that all of our desired careers have a projected growth over the next few years, aside from Zac’s chosen career, we all will eventually require some form of programming skills also. Across all chosen careers, communication skills are highly regarded and Project Management skills are very much sought after in the IT sector, with all of our chosen careers requiring these skills. The most obvious common element is that we’re all, obviously, working with computers and programs that facilitate our job requirements, however, a more niche form of that is that we’re all going to require a good understanding of our chosen IT field in order to excel in the competitive market.</p>

          <h4>Differences between all roles:</h4>

          <p>The differences between our chosen roles boil down to the style of work that we’re applying for. Those interested in Cyber Security have a more technical role than the others and will require more tactical thinking in order to excel in the area. The Graphical Design field, however, is a more creative role and will require more artistic talent, as well as creative thinking. Financial Planning will require more personal skills than the others and certainly require more personal skills, if working with clients, than the other chosen professions.</p>

          <h4>How similar are our career plans?</h4>

          <p>The chosen career plans of each of us seems fairly similar, in that we’re all studying a Bachelor of IT in order to get ourselves “in-the-door”, so to speak, in the field of IT. After that, is where our chosen profession paths differ, as, for example, those interested in Cyber Security could potentially go on to do an internship or, with some luck, a junior position, whereas I would have to create a portfolio of some kind to show off my ability in VR/AR and use that to apply directly for my chosen job, using my acquired degree as a supporting document for my competence in the role.</p>

          <h3>Ethan Fleming</h3>

          <p>It was quite interesting to read through everyone's ideal jobs. Pretty much everyone in our group has the same goal of ending up in a Cyber Security type job eventually. Which I find quite interesting. If this is a pattern amongst other groups, it may mean that not many job opportunities are available at the end of this course. But after looking at the demand for Cyber Security Professionals there is a massive demand. There are also so many different facets of Cyber Security, so within that job term there are many different specialisations and areas to work within Cyber Security. I think that even though we all have the same interests of being a cyber security specialist, there are so many different branches in that field that it won't create job issues in the future if our groups interests are a trend. It's interesting to see that 4 of our 6 group members (Autin Knight, Adrian Leveris, myself, and Jade Gower) want to end up in a Cyber Security field. Due to that fact there isn't much differentiation between those 4 peoples chosen fields for work. But Nathan Jenkins and Zachary Vine have 2 very different ideal jobs with Nathan wanting to work in the Virtual Reality field, and Zachary focusing on the Financial side of things. I personally think that Cyber Security, Virtual Reality, and Financial Planning are 3 fields that are closely related. And if you worked in one area I dont think it would be too difficult to transfer over to another. They are all very clearly I.T related jobs, and I think it's really cool to see where everyone wants to head in the future career wise. I think some of the main difference is that Nathan's role would rely heavily on programming and designing Virtual Reality programs, which would contain a large amount of visually aided design. While Cyber Security Is more of a heavy problem solving field of work, with a lot of having to make quick decisions and act under pressure. Cyber Security professionals have to be able to make decisions under a lot of pressure, while solving multiple problems and then acting on those solutions to create a safe work environment.</p>

          <h3>Jade Gower</h3>

          <p>I don't find it surprising that there are four of our team members with an original common goal of Cyber Security. Cyber Security is a much needed and ever growing industry. Cyber Security is also a very broad term, so the differences in the jobs we seek could be major. I know Adrian has changed his views and is looking towards programming now, but he may look at the security measures in games. Ethan would be working as a consultant for many companies, I might go into local government and work on the smaller scale of things while Austin is looking at software security and cloud application development. I think we’re all on a similar path, maybe liking it to high school, we all go there, some of us are just at different stages.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Austin Knight</h3>

          <p>Everyone in our group has projected growth within their anticipated career pathway except Zac’s as his is not stated. We will all ultimately need some programming skills to further ourselves in careers. Communication and Management skills are the most sought-after skills in the in the IT industry. We will all require a strong set of verbal, writing and common computer skills to progress ourselves.</p>

          <p>The differences between our chosen career paths are not different in industry (except Zac) but different in position. Those working towards a role in Cyber Security will need to be prepared for rigorous testing work with a strategic mindset, while Nathan in Graphic design will need a creative mindset. Nathan will need to be prepared to develop his artistic skills as he progresses his career. Zac is in a completely different industry and has his sights on the most contrasting job compared to the rest of the team. He will require different interpersonal skills such as listening and negotiation to progress as a Financial Planner.</p>

          <p>Our groups career plans are most similar than different, as we are all studying this subject of Introduction of IT. We will all at one stage need to develop a portfolio to show off our IT skills to potential employers. Relating to the Burning Glass data, we all require similar skills not related to computers to help us progress our careers.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Zachary Vine</h3>

          <p>Excluding myself, whose ideal job is outside of the IT sector as a financial planner, there are a lot of similarities amongst the group. 4 out of 6 of the group have ideal jobs falling under the umbrella of Cyber Security and the 5th has his ideal job as an AR/VR Technical Officer, which although outside the scope of Cyber Security, holds certain similarities in respect to required technical skills such as using various coding languages. Whilst my ideal job requires no knowledge of such similar skills, my research does suggest that knowledge in SAP and Oracle could prove beneficial whereas these don’t rank of any importance to the other members of the group as far as I can see. All 6 jobs have similarities regarding non-technical required skills, such as good communication skills, ability to meet deadlines and a proficiency in problem solving. These similarities will be explored further in the industry data section of the report.</p>
