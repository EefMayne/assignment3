          <h2>Our groups ideal jobs and how they rank in demand from employees</h2>

          <hr>

          <h3>Cyber Security Specialist</h3>

          <h4>(Austin Knight, Adrian Leveris, Ethan Fleming, Jade Gower)</h4>

          <p>Interestingly enough the burning glass data provided did not seem to encapsulate the role of the Cyber Security Specialist, which is surprising because according to recruiters and career site experts it is the most in demand tech job of 2019 (Rayome, 2019)<sup>1</sup> and according to other resources there will be 3.5 million unfilled cyber security jobs by 2021 (Morgan, 2019)<sup>2</sup>. However, we did manage to secure another report from Burning Glass Technologies which specifically illustrates the demand for the Cyber Security Specialist. Two key points were:</p>

          <li>The number of cyber security job postings has grown 94% since 2013, compared to only 30% for IT positions overall. That’s over three times faster than the overall growth in the IT market (Burning Glass Technologies, 2019)<sup>3</sup>.</li>

          <li>Cyber security jobs account for 13% of all information technology jobs. On average, however, cyber security jobs take 20% longer to fill than other IT jobs, and they pay 16% more. This helps to illustrate high demand. (Burning Glass Technologies, 2019).</li>

          <p>There are three main reasons that we are using such a broad ideal job title when personal profiles have previously illustrated more specific titles within the sector:</p>

          <li>A quick internet search will instantly reveal just how broad of a term Cyber Security Specialist is, with it taking only a few minutes to find 50+ job titles that fall under the umbrella of this one. However, for the most part, they all require very similar, if not identical, IT specific and general skills. This variance in titles also means that there are titles within the scope of cyber security which could accurately be given multiple titles which would still accurately portray the specific role.</li>

          <li>Due to this aforementioned variance of job titles within the industry resulting in multiple representations for near identical roles, it is our contention that measurement of the demand for these specific roles is a lot harder to measure due to the inconsistencies of collected data not giving an accurate representation of all available positions or possibly including positions which are not suitable.</li>

          <li>Another variable which makes measuring demand for such specific roles within the industry is that according to Burning Glass Technologies, for most IT roles, Cyber Security is just one of many responsibilities within the role as opposed to a dedicated responsibility, and over 50% of IT jobs demanding cybersecurity skills are in fact completely different roles where security is only one part of a broader job description.</li>

          <hr>

          <h3>AR/VR Technical Officer</h3>

          <h4>(Nathan Jenkins)</h4>

          <p>Another job title which may be to specific to fall into the broader roles illustrated in the burning glass data, the AR/VR (Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality) is another sector where demand is just going to increase. Rogers, points out that a recent report (Rogers, 2019)<sup>4</sup> from the International Data Corps, shows worldwide revenues for the AR and VR market are forecast to increase by 100 percent or more over the next four years. With total spending set to hit some $215 billion by 2021. This growth is reflected by looking at a small American business called EON, which began in 1999 with two workers and grew to 90 by 2015. Today, it has nearly 250 employees and is looking to add 110 more in the next year as demand for VR and AR products increases.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Financial Planner</h3>

          <h4>(Zachary Vine)</h4>

          <p>As this job falls well outside the scope of the IT sector, it obviously isn’t included within supplied data. However, there are some IT skills which are required to be able to perform within the role of financial planner and these will be explored within the section pertaining to our groups required skills. Advisor Logic (2019), states there is an upward trend in demand for financial planners due in part to the fact that disposable income in Australian households is increasing and because we have an ageing population. By 2027 nearly 20% of the Australian population will be over the age of 65a and history dictates these individuals will be more likely to turn to financial planners as they near retirement (Advisor Logic, 2019)<sup>5</sup>.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Our groups required skill set - I.T specific skills</h2>

          <p>Several sources cited that knowledge of various programming languages is a must for anyone wanting to make it in Cyber Security, with knowledge of C/C++ and Python being the two most important (Ruddy, 2019)<sup>6</sup>, followed closely by JavaScript, PHP and SQL (Garbade, 2019)<sup>7</sup>. Recently, within the cloud ecosystem, other languages have risen to prominence as well such as Perl and Ruby, and PHP, Java, and .NET continue to be popular (Kumar, 2019)<sup>8</sup>, so it stands to reason these would be necessary skills for someone focusing on cloud security specifically. For a role such as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), an individual will require Project Management skills as they must organize and coordinate technical vulnerability assessments (Dice Insights, 2019)<sup>9</sup>.</p>

          <p>When it comes to AR/VR the industry is looking for strong programming skills on one hand and on the flip-side people who know modelling, graphic design and how to render 3D environments (Rogers, 2019). Surprisingly, Rogers further points out that it is one of the few IT industries where employers may focus more on a prospects passion and creativity than their technical skills.</p>

          <p>Half (2019)<sup>10</sup> states that the increased focus on digitisation and automation has encouraged more hiring managers to look toward financial professionals with the right IT skills to leverage new financial systems. As such Candidates who can demonstrate knowledge and proficiency in SAP accounting software or Oracle will find themselves in-demand. Obviously, ability to navigate the Windows OS and perform tasks in Microsoft Office are necessary skills for almost every professional.</p>

          <p>Below is an edited version of the Burning Glass Data which has been adjusted to illustrate the demand for our groups required IT skill set (skills included within our skill set have been highlighted in red.). It illustrates that not only does our group meet 60% of the illustrated skills, when we consider that most of those skills rank highly within the data, it pushes our demand up to 67% overall. This would suggest that our IT specific skill set is rated very highly by employers.</p>

          <p>The three highest ranked IT specific skills which are not in our required IT specific skill set list are Business Management, Business Analysis and Technical Support.</p>

          <p>Below is an edited version of the Burning Glass Data which has been adjusted to illustrate the demand for our groups required general skill set (skills included within our skill set have been highlighted in red.). It illustrates that not only does our group meet 68% of the illustrated skills, when we consider that yet again most of those skills rank highly within the data, in this instance it pushes our demand up to a massive 86.6% overall. At a glance this would be in part due to the massive demand illustrated for communication skills, however, with this removed from the equation entirely we still come in at 82.8% overall.</p>

          <p>The three highest ranked general skills which are not in our required general skill set list are Research, Mentoring and Team Building.</p>

          <h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>

          <hr>

          <h3>Austin Knight<i> (Cyber Security Specialist)</i></h3>

          <p>My opinion of my ideal job has not changed despite looking at the burning glass data. Currently I endeavour to have a strong career in cyber security as I have always had an interest in the security aspect of technology.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Adrian Leveris<i> (Cyber Security Specialist)</i></h3>

          <p>After analysing the Burning Glass data, yes my opinion of my ideal has changed after I did some more research on my role as it isn’t in high demand at the moment but the role is still very necessary for the future as security needs to evolve as there are always new threats being developed with data and information at risk. I will say being a Developer is a much more interesting role as I have always enjoyed Programming and pairing that with Cyber Security would pair well together and considering that problem-solving skills is in high demand developing software/applications that can solve security problems. At the end of the day I would prefer being a Developer after researching more into Cyber Security and I have always enjoyed coding and watching applications/software come together.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Ethan Fleming<i> (Cyber Security Specialist)</i></h3>

          <p>After reading the burning glass data, it did worry me a bit not seeing that Cyber Security Specialists are in high need. But after doing more research I discovered that Cyber Security is quite a broad term, and that a lot of the high demand jobs fall under the field of Cyber Security. This is good for me, because that means that the job that I want to do is in high demand and can go whatever direction I would like it to. After looking at the high demand general skills it was good to see that my skills fit in with the ones that are in high demand, this just reinforces my dream of doing a cyber security job. As it shows that my skills are needed in the workplace and that it shouldn't be too hard for me to find a job. Looking at the I.T specific skills was an eye opener as it showed me all the coding languages etc that employees are looking for. This did worry me a bit as I don't know many different coding languages, but I also have a couple more years until my degree is finished, and I’m a quick learner. So hopefully I can learn some of the high demand languages by the time I’ve finished this course.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Nathan Jenkins<i> (AR/VR Technical Officer)</i></h3>

          <p>Although my ideal job isn’t illustrated specifically inside the data, other cited sources within demonstrate a high demand within the sector and I have not changed my mind about my selected role. Further to this point, it is my contention that the strong request for my jobs particular required skill set, such as graphic design, not only supports the argument that there is a robust industry growth not shown in the data, but working towards this job role also puts me in a favourable position due to having a an easily transferable and sought after skill set.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Zachary Vine<i> (Financial Planner)</i></h3>

          <p>The Burning Glass data has done little to influence me one way or another because, as previously stated, my ideal job falls outside the scope illustrated by the data which presents information solely around the IT field. Other cited sources, particularly Advisor Logic (2019), have illustrated a strong growth in the sector with an upward trend in the foreseeable future. Based on this information I see no reason to doubt my choice of ideal job role. I was interested however to learn about the strong demand for IT specific skills within the sector, particularly relating to specific specialist software suites, which has given me a lot to think about.</p>
