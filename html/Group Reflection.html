        <h3>Ethan Fleming</h3>

        <h4>What went well?</h4>

        <p>Our groups communication went well. We used Discord, Google Docs, and Facebook Messenger to stay in contact constantly. If we had any issues, we were able to solve them quickly due to the constant communication. Regarding our teamwork, we were able to organise who did what easily. And this resulted in everything going smoothly.</p>

        <h4>What could be improved?</h4>

        <p>I didn’t do a great job with letting other people do their own stuff. I micromanaged too much. Resulting in some people getting annoyed. Next time I’ll leave people alone more, and trust that they get their jobs done.</p>

        <h4>One thing that was surprising</h4>

        <p>The thing that was surprising to me was the amount of work that got done in such a short space of time. Everyone worked well given the small-time limit.</p>

        <h4>At least one thing that I have learnt about groups</h4>

        <p>Micromanaging isn’t the best way to get stuff done. Much  better to trust that the group gets their jobs done by the due date.</p>

        <h3>Adrian Gordon Leveris</h3>

        <h4>What went well?</h4>

        <p>Regarding what went in our group, well I would consider our overall group social atmosphere was exceptional, considering we didn’t know each other. I will say that right off the bat everyone was committed to helping the group by volunteering to complete tasks and if we had any questions, they were answered in our weekly Discord chats or during our discussions on Facebook or Discord. I was committed to making sure that we had a team leader with the help of Ethan in order to make sure everyone knew what they were doing, and tasks were completed. Our group was certainly productive, and everyone was open to helping one another about certain tasks in the assignment and we did not have any conflicting views on things. I was surprised with how well we all worked together, and I would be happy to work with the same group of like minded people again.</p>

        <h4>What could be improved</h4>

        <p>I will say that there was micromanaging at times where we were pushing each other to get things done, and I believe that would be something we need to work on as a group for next time. I know that I personally didn’t have much time to work on the assignment due to being so busy with working full-time, so I know I would need to work on my time-management skills.</p>

        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>

        <p>Honestly the most surprising thing was the fact that even though we were all very different regarding our abilities and skill sets we were still able to work together as a team exceptionally well.</p>

        <h4>At least one thing that I have learnt about groups</h4>

        <p>If everyone has the same goal in mind to complete a task by the deadline then we should have no trouble achieving it.</p>

	      <h4>What went well</h4>
	      <p>Our communication as a group was stellar and everyone had a fair say in what was going on. Our use of various platforms such as Facebook messenger, Discord and Google Drive was a key factor in our ability to get this project done seamlessly. Everyone in our group was willing to give everyone a hand with their own work to ensure we got the best result possible.</p>
	      <h4>What could be improved</h4>
	      <p>My time management skills to ensure I do not negatively affect the rest of the group. At times I felt like I was letting my team mates down due to not getting work done in a suitable time. I can improve on this next time by allocating time during the early days to plan appropriately when I will get tasks done.</p>
	      <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
	      <p>Everyone in our group had common interests despite coming from different walks of life. We all had a can-do attitude and were very respectful, positive and friendly to each other.</p>
	      <h4>At least one thing I have learnt about groups</h4>
	      <p>They are so effective if everyone in the group has the same common goal. Due to everyone having similar interests in IT, it was such a stress-free assignment. I am appreciative of that.</p>

        <h3>Jade Gower</h3>

        <h4>What went well?</h4>

        <p>I feel that considering we have come from different walks of life; we have worked very well together. Some took up the leadership of the group, others took up leadership of certain areas (i.e. the website) but everyone knew what they had to do and got it done.</p>

        <h4>What could be improved</h4>

        <p>I do feel that our time management needs to be improved in order to help people try and stick to their work. I don't think that I realised how much time would be needed to be spent on certain areas and really should've put the time in earlier. </p>

        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>

        <p>One thing that surprised me was how I, myself, worked in the group. I am very introverted, very quiet, but the group always helped made me feel at ease, which was a great feeling. I was expecting to divide the work and come back at a later point with it finished.</p>

        <h4>At least one thing that I have learnt about groups</h4>

        <p>One thing I learnt about groups is that they are hard to manage. Especially with online learning, everyone's schedules are different, some people are available through the day, others later at night. Some people have differing ideas to you, and you need to learn to speak up and put your ideas forward and to always have an open mind towards others ideas.</p>

        <h3>Nathan Jenkins</h3>

        <h4>What went well?</h4>

        <p>I  believe that our group's communication efforts worked extremely well. At any point that one of us had an issue, question or comment, the entire team knew almost immediately, which was great for any sudden obstacles.  Our organization was also amazing, I often found that if I needed a piece of information for my portion, someone else on my team already had it lined up. I'm really glad I was accepted into this team.</p>

        <h4>What could be improved</h4>

        <p>Certainly my own time management. I feel like I could have done more if I didn't procrastinate and set myself a clear-cut schedule to follow in order to maximize my efficiency.</p>

        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>

        <p>How well everyone got on! I'm a very socially anxious person and one of my biggest concerns was that I wasn't going to get along with people when it came to working in groups. The team I am in, almost immediately put those fears to rest with how nice and supportive they are.</p>

        <h4>At least one thing that I have learnt about groups</h4>

        <p>I always dreaded group assignments, constantly thinking to myself "I'd much rather work alone." Working in this team not only taught me that teamwork can be fun, but it can also get huge projects finished in an insanely short amount of time.</p>

        <h3>Zac Vine</h3>

        <h4>What went well?</h4>

        <p>I think the lack of conflict was great, I almost always expect there to be some sort of conflict issue when undertaking group projects, but there was none. I would also point out I don’t believe this to be due to an abundance of individuals with a passive nature but instead to be due to a genuine want to contribute and be a part of the team.</p>

        <h4>What could be improved</h4>

        <p>Time management, this is probably the only area I think we maybe lacking. As a person new to studying online and a full time father I have a hard time managing my own time, never lone trying to manage it around 5 other individuals all of whom obviously have their own things going on as well, some of which aren’t even in the same time zone. I think this is something we can improve on going forward as we learn more about when each other are available and split work requiring more than one of us into suitable partnerships.</p>

        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>

        <p>I think at times this team of people where possibly genuinely considerate and respectful of each other to a fault. I feel it sometimes made decision making take a little longer and created unexpected work for individuals who were just too eager to help out, that being said I don’t feel anyone took advantage of this and everyone was the same when taking on extra pieces so this is not necessarily a bad thing except it possibly slowed processes down a little bit and conceivably impacted our time management a bit as well.</p>

        <h4>At least one thing that I have learnt about groups</h4>

        <p>When everyone is working towards the same goal, a team of like-minded individuals can come together in a strong, positive, conflict-free way. Open communication can allow people with different skill sets to really compliment each other, even when those skills at a first glance may not be beneficial. This is the first time I have completed an entire group project and genuinely had no problems with any of the other members.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>Every single person in our group endeavoured to achieve well in this assessment piece which was the biggest positive take away from this project. We had a great mix of individuals who took pride in their work which is portrayed in our final submission. The segregation of jobs was a stress-free process as everyone was so willing to do whatever they needed for the team to succeed. We used Google Drive to merge all our content together. We used Discord to communicate as a group and Facebook messenger to send non-urgent messages. Our overall communication amongst each other was exceptional which led to us being a very productive group. We understood everyone’s strengths and weaknesses – which led to easily allocating jobs as a team.</p>

        <p>There are not many things that need to be improved upon for next time except for time management. We all had our own separate tasks to complete but some relied on others to be completed to then complete their work. Many of us did not have enough allocated time in our busy lives to work on this assessment piece so creating a schedule of team agreed due dates would have been a great idea. The micromanagement was great to push each other to get the project completed but next time a schedule should be in place to ensure we do not need to hassle one another. Overall the only significant improvement for next time would be to manage our time individually and as a group more efficiently.</p>

        <p>We all got along with each other instantly. This was a huge surprise to many of us as we all understood that each of us had commitments outside of this project from the get-go. We were all genuinely considerate and respectful to each other.</p>

        <p>When everyone has the same mindset to achieve well, they can achieve strong results. Open communication is the most important factor in a group setting and if it is done well – anything is possible. We all learnt that team assessments can be a fun learning curve in our studies if they are done correctly and respectfully.</p>
