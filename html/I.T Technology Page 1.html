            <h2>What does it do?</h2>

            <hr>

            <p>Cyber security is the process of protecting electronic systems, online networks and computer programs from malicious attacks in the form of viruses, spyware and malware to name a few.</p>

            <p>According to <a href = "https://www.arnnet.com.au/article/645251/information-security-spending-reach-3-9b-australia/">arnnet.com.au</a>, Australians are spending almost $3.9B on security which includes services such as consulting, hardware support, implementation and IT outsourcing services.</p>

            <p>Cyber security is essential in protecting our hardware, software and digital data from theft and/or damage. As our online world grows, so does the threat of cyber attacks.</p>

              <h2>What is the state of the art of this new technology?</h2>

              <p>Businesses are building new offices to hold their advanced cyber security facilities. The state-of-the-art cyber security headquarters sole focus is the protection of digital data, hardware and software of their customers from malicious attacks.</p>

            </div>

            <hr>

            <h2>What can be done now?</h2>

            <p>There are lots of things you can do now to protect your family’s data.</p>

            <li>Use strong passwords for all your online accounts.</li>

            <p>A strong password should be hard to guess, contain at least one capital letter and one number. You should also have different passwords for each account you have.</p>

            <li>Don’t click on links that you are unsure of.</li>

            <p>A lot of people make the mistake of clicking a link without thinking. If you’re not sure about the link that you see, ask the person who sent it. A link may send you to “phishing” sites where it collects your data.</p>

            <li>Use a trusted antivirus software.</li>

            <p>Protect your data from theft with antivirus. You should have an antivirus that includes antivirus, antispyware and anti-phishing as a minimum<sup>1</sup>.</p>

            <p>Parliaments are now changing the way companies can collect and use private citizens personal data.</p>

            <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) approved by the European Parliament in 2016 which replaced the Data Protection Directive 95/46/ec in 2018, is the fundamental law followed by companies in the protection of the digital data of European citizens.</p>

            <p>Under the GDPR terms, companies have to see fit that their customers personal data is collected in a legal way under strict conditions and that if a data breach does happen, their customers data is protected from misuse or they will face penalties for failing to do so<sup>2</sup>.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>What is likely to be able to do be done soon?</h2>

            <p>Stricter laws will be imposed governing the rights and responsibilities of both the customer and the businesses.</p>

            <p>Harsh penalties will be put into action when the people behind the attacks are caught and brought to justice.</p>

            <p>New and more advanced anti-virus software will be developed to help the customers stop attacks before they happen.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h2>

            <p>Companies are developing smarter more sophisticated security measures every day. One company, Trend Micro have developed a new solution called XGen that has several key attributes detailed below.</p>

            <li>Smart</li>

            <p>Protects against the full range of known and unknown threats using a cross-generational blend of threat defence techniques that applies the right technique at the right time, and is powered by global threat intelligence.</p>

            <li>Optimized</li>

            <p>Delivers security solutions to protect users, networks, and hybrid cloud environments – all designed specifically for and tightly integrated with leading platforms and applications, like VMware, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft® Azure™, Google Cloud, Office365, and more.</p>

            <li>Connected</li>

            <p>Speeds time to response with automatic sharing of threat intelligence across security layers and centralized visibility and control XGen™ security uses proven techniques to quickly identify known good or bad data, freeing advanced techniques to more quickly and accurately identify unknown threats. This identification in rapid succession with right-time technology regardless of location and device across a connected system, maximizes both visibility and performance. This core set of techniques powers each of the Trend Micro solutions, in a way that is optimized for each layer of security: hybrid clouds, networks, and user environments<sup>3</sup>.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>

            <p>The world is moving online more and more each day. In order to keep up with the threats of harmful attacks, we need to stay one step ahead to keep the attacks at bay. We, as a society, will become smarter when browsing online.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>What is the potential impact of this development?</h2>

            <p>The potential impact will be towards the hackers who start the viruses. It will make it harder for them to succeed and when caught, they will be given harsher penalties. Children are exposed to technology from a young age these days which means they learn the do’s & don’ts of the internet. Just as we learn to look both ways when crossing a road, children are taught not to click links they’re unsure of.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>What is likely to change?</h2>

            <p>New laws in regards of data collection will come about. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 was signed by California Governor Jerry Brown and is due to go into effect by the end of 2019. It is an act that increases the rights of privacy and the protection of the residents of California, United States<sup>4</sup>. The rise in VPNs in 2018 will continue to grow as people take control of their data into their own hands.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Which people will be most affected and how?</h2>

            <p>The current generation will be the most affected with these changes.  With new viruses and new technology coming out every year, we are the ones who must keep up with the demands. The next generation of people will come in where they have learnt about how to defend themselves from attacks from an early age.</p>

            <div class = "create">

              <h2>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h2>

              <p>This will create new jobs in the cyber security industry. With new threats, breaches of data & viruses popping up all the time, more people will be needed to help stop the attacks. New security software, more advanced software, will need to be developed in order to stay ahead of the hackers.</p>

            </div>

            <hr>

            <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>

            <p>This will affect myself personally because I will need to keep learning in order to be one step ahead. By continuing to learn and research how my data is used by businesses, I will learn how to best protect my myself and my family’s data.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>In your daily life, how will this affect you?</h2>

            <p>It will affect my daily life because I will need to read each article on websites I visit to see what data they will collect, how they use it and if they sell it and to whom. I will need to spend more money on internet security, both on anti-virus software and on VPN’s to help protect my privacy.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>What will be different for you?</h2>

            <p>Not a lot will be different for me. As long as I stay protected as best I can, be smart about what information I give out, and teach my family and friends how to stay protected, I can continue to browse the internet safely.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h2>

            <p>Older members of my family do struggle with the online world in general, so I do help them by teaching them how to browse safely and what not to click. My friends are wise when it comes to not clicking links, but by giving them further advice on anti-virus software and giving them the choice to use VPN’s I can help them learn to browse safely too. The children need to be taught to ask questions. By asking questions about links or pop-ups, they will learn what is safe and what is not safe.</p>
