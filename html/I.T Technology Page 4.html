          <h2>What does it do?</h2>

          <hr> 

          <h3>Raspberry PI</h3>

          <p>Well a Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit card sized computer that can be plugged right into a computer display or TV and uses a standard keyboard and mouse<sup>1</sup>. The original plan was for the Raspberry Pi to be an accessible and affordable computer for kids to learn programming, but because it was so successful with over 12 million units sold it allows users to explore computing and learn how to program in languages like Python. It can do everything that you would expect a computer could do right now from surfing the net, and gambling, high definition video, to making spreadsheets, phrase-processing, and playing video games. It has also been used to interact with the outside world in a wide variety of different projects ranging from music machines, facial recognition, parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras.</p>

          <p>Raspberry Pi has already such a huge range of developments with that it’s not possible to talk about all of them. Regarding what can be done soon developers will be looking at making more automated systems to aid in everyday life. With the release of Raspberry Pi 4 with its increase overall performance to its predecessor Raspberry Pi 3 through a new CPU, new RAM and increased GPU speeds with support for 4K output a lot more projects can be possible<sup>2</sup>. With future develops such as automated lights, fans and being able to view anything around your house through projected light without needing a screen to view it using sensors. This adds to reducing energy consumption. Entering a room using black box technology, the internet, relay board, light sensor, temperature sensor, breadboard, using Raspbian operating system, and an application on your phone to control it all<sup>3</sup>. We can expect to see mobility in cities increased by optimizing the public transport system, vehicle flows and traffic conditions in rush hours. The desired goal is public vehicle (Bus) tracking using GPS with expansion boards connected to Raspberry Pi to provide communication of data and localization through the cellular network<sup>4</sup>.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Arduinos</h3>

          <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform primarily based on smooth-to-use hardware and software <sup>6</sup>. Arduino circuit boards (referred to as a microcontroller) are capable of reading inputs, light on a sensor, a finger on a button or a twitter message and turn it into an output, activating a motor, turning on a LED light, publishing something on a line. The Arduino does not need a separate programmer (separate piece of hardware) in order to load new code onto the board, it can be done with just a USB cable. Over time Arduino has been the mind of lots of projects, from normal gadgets to complicated clinical units. Right now, Arduino can be used to build a weather display system, motion triggered light lamp for under your bed, muting any phrase you want on tv, build a fingerprint scanner for your garage door opener, build a robotic arm, build an autonomous “follow me” cooler and build a personalized alarm system <sup>7</sup>.These are just some of the projects that have already been created with this useful technology. The current focus for Arduino is to work on Internet of Things (IoT) communications.</p>

          <p>In the future we can expect to see Arduino being used to reduce the cost of prototyping, allowing companies iterate during development, leading to better more functional state-of-the-art products such as a parking system used to manage free parking spots, indirectly reducing congestion and car accidents while also reducing the time it takes to find a parking space<sup>4</sup>. Using Infra-Red (IR) sensors to detect if a parking spot is free, using an LCD display in the parking lot entrance to obtain information about free spots<sup>4</sup>. With the use of RFID cars to manage authorization if it’s a public or private car park<sup>4</sup>. All this hardware will be processed locally using the Arduino board, with an ESP8266 module we can communicate this information wirelessly so this information can be sent to an external system to inform users of the current parking lot state<sup>4</sup>. This can also be paired with Raspberry Pi and drivers can verify available space through the use of their smartphones. They will be able to do things that you aren’t able to do with remote sensor networks right now which could lead to making buildings more comfortable, saving energy and reducing maintenance costs for equipment, with new control strategies<sup>8</sup>. We can expect Arduinos being used to implement these developments<sup>8</sup>.</p>

		  <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>

          <hr>

          <h3>Raspberry Pi public mobility system</h3>

          <p>We can expect the mobility system to impact efficient movement of vehicles, reduce accidents, reduce congestion, tracking public vehicles in urban city areas to enhance mobility around the city when traveling.</p>

          <p>With the growing need for energy efficient, cost efficient, reduced size, robustness, and communication technology being ideal for new technology systems to be developed we can expect the government looking to prototype new developments that can improve their overall mobility around urban city areas through the use of IoT open-source electronic platforms. This allows for trip planning, identify bottlenecks, and adjust services based on real-time conditions<sup>9</sup>.</p>

          <p>The people that would most likely be affected with this development are the people living in urban city areas, and people traveling to the city via public transport or their own vehicles. This system will allow for reduced travel times for people and easier trip planning when traveling around the city.</p>

          <p>I feel as though this system will create new jobs in the government allowing experienced technology team to make traffic management system that can be developed to improve the overall congestion issue in cities.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Arduinos parking system</h3>

          <p>So, the potential impact of this development would be indirectly reducing congestion and car accidents when trying to find a parking spot in urban areas by allowing users to verify whether a vehicle parking spot is free without the need of driving around everywhere looking for a spot.</p>

          <p>We can expect governments or corporations testing prototype open-source technology systems in the future that will allow for vehicle parking in the city in order to improve city life and reduce the road congestion while trying to find available parking spots.</p>

          <p>The people that will be affected by this would be people traveling to and from work, and people traveling to the city. This system will make finding an available vehicle parking spot easier to find and allow for a more efficient travel experience in the city.</p>

          <p>I feel that this system will create more jobs by giving experienced technology users the chance to develop an advanced parking management system.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>

          <hr>

          <h3>Raspberry Pi public mobility system</h3>

          <p>In my daily life this type of system should make traveling, and planning trips while using public transport system to the city much easier and more convenient for me when needing to go somewhere. Although I don’t live in the city or rarely travel to the city it won’t really affect me at all, but it could be implemented in urban areas with a lot of congestion outside of the city as well, so it certainly would make things easier for me.</p>

          <p>This system will make a world of difference for a lot of people not just myself in the future if we see it developed as it will allow users to track current road conditions, traffic congestion during peak hours, and work out how far away the bus is from your arriving and sending you alerts if they have taken a different route.</p>

          <p>I could certainly see this being a very useful system when family and friends are looking to travel via public transport or via their own vehicles when in another state or country, they do not know too well as it will improve their experience with more convenience.</p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Arduinos parking system</h3>

          <p>This system will certainly be useful in my daily life as I’m always having to go to the shopping centre during the week and at times it can be highly congested especially on Saturdays. So, a system where I would be able to verify where an available vehicle parking spot would save me time having to look for ages.</p>

          <p>This will make a world of difference to everyone not just me in the future if it is developed. It will save me time and be much more convenient for me to look up available spots on my phone rather than mucking around driving everywhere.</p>

          <p>I could certainly see this being a great addition to my family and friends as it will make their lives easier when they are going shopping or need to go somewhere as trying to find a parking spot in a congested area is so much of a pain for a lot of people.</p>
